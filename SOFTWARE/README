---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In here you will find instructions for building the project and a
short description of each source file.

There is quite a bit of starter code for project 4. It contains math
utility functions and classes, code to load the application, code to load
models, and code to handle mouse/keyboard input.

Report any bugs to the TAs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building the Code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Linux
-------------------------

Run 'make' to build the code. All builds are done in the 'bin/' directory,
and the final binary is copied to the top-level directory.

There are two build modes: debug and release. Debug is the default. Debug
builds with no optimizations and debugging info, while release builds with
optimizations and no debugging info. Run 'make MODE=debug' or
'make MODE=release' to build the different modes. We highly suggest using
debug mode while developing the code.

NOTE: You be at a physical machine to build on school machines. Using
ssh and X-forwarding will not work, and won't even compile. If you do
not wish to be at school and don't have Linux on your home machine, we
have a build for Visual Studio on Windows. You will, however, still have
to make sure it works on the school machines.

All needed libraries and headers are installed on school machines. If
building on your own machine, you will need to install headers/libs for:
-SDL
-libpng

Windows
-------------------------

For convenience, we provide a Visual Studio 2008 solution for the project.
You can find it in the msvc/ folder. All needed external headers, libraries,
and dlls are included.

Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition is freely available and suitable for
buildilng the project.

Note: since the current directory will be the msvc/ folder when debugging, 
the application will not correctly find the models/ folder at runtime.
Therefore, you must either change the current directory for debugging or
copy the models/ folder into the msvc/ folder.

Note: Your program MUST COMPILE on the SCS Linux machines. If you use
Windows, make sure to test on Linux well in advance of the deadline.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the Program
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

./binsol/debug/raytracer.exe [-r] [-d width height] input_scene [output_file]

Options:

    -r:
        Raytraces the scene and saves to the output file without
        loading a window or creating an opengl context.
    -d width height
        The dimensions of image to raytrace (and window if using
        and opengl context. Defaults to width=800, height=600.
    input_scene:
        The scene file to load and raytrace.
    output_file:
        The output file in which to write the rendered images.
        If not specified, default timestamped filenames are used.

Instructions:

    Press 'r' to raytrace the scene. Press 'r' again to go back to
    go back to OpenGL rendering. Press 'f' to dump the most recently
    raytraced image to the output file.

    Use the mouse and 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'q', and 'e' to move the
    camera around. The keys translate the camera, and left and right
    mouse buttons rotate the camera.

    If not using windowed mode (i.e., -r was specified), then output
    image will be automatically generated and the program will exit.

C++ Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the sake of simpler math routines and data structures, the code uses
C++ over straight C. The code tries to stay away from most features of the
language to keep it as simple as possible. This project attempts to break
you into C++ easily.

Questions about virtual functions, classes, or any C++ idioms are welcome.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Source Files and Directory Structure
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code base is rather big, so here's a description of the top-level
directories and every header/source file pair we give you. You are free
to edit any of them and add as many as you like, as long as the program
behavior remains the same.

You should have a look at:
- writeup.txt
- src/raytracer/raytracer.cpp and hpp
- src/scene/*.hpp

Note: we omit the '.cpp' or '.hpp' from the source file names
in the follow listing.

Legend:
#   - must edit this file
*   - should look at (header) file

README              -- this file
writeup.txt#        -- Description of your project and implementation.

Makefile            -- makefile for the project.
make.mk             -- more of the makefile.
sources.mk          -- list of sources and target, edit to add new source files

models/             -- models used in scenes.
images/             -- textures used in scenes.
scenes/*            -- scenes on which to test your program.
reference_shots/*   -- images of each scene created with the referece solution

msvc/               -- Visual Studio 2008 build files and solution.

src/glsl/           == Project-specific files. Main file to edit is here.
    main            -- Main function, application backend, and scene rendering.
    raytracer#      -- Shell for implementation. This is the main file you
                        must edit.

src/application/    == General application files. You can ignore all of it.
    application     -- SDL backend, runs main loop.
    camera_roam     -- Functions for camera control via mouse and keyboard.
    imageio         -- Functions to load and save PNG files.
    opengl          -- Header to include correct OpenGL headers.
    scene_loader    -- Code to load a scene from a file.

src/math/           == Math utilities.
    camera*         -- Camera class with functions to mutate.
    color           -- A class for RGB colors and related functions.
    math            -- Basic header and a few generic functions.
    matrix          -- 3D, 4D matrix classes and several related functions.
    quaternion      -- Quaternion class and several related functions--very
                        useful for 3D rotations.
    vector          -- 2D, 3D, 4D vector classes and many related functions.

src/scene/          == Scene-specific files and rendering. You can ignore all
                        of this (though you'll need to use it the raytracer).

src/tinyxml/        == XML parser, used with scenes. You can ignore this.
